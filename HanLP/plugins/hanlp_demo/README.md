# Demos and examples for HanLP

This package is intended for demonstration purpose and won't be released to pypi. **Training requires a fair understanding of Linux and Python which might not be the case for everybody.**

You need a Linux/macOS system with Internet on because some corpora and bash scripts will be downloaded during training. Training on Windows might work if you are an expert but we believe it's very rare.

Your `python` command needs to be Python2 while `python3` needs to be Python3.

You need to install this package and run it from the **root** folder of HanLP.

```bash
pip install -e plugins/hanlp_demo
python3 plugins/hanlp_demo/hanlp_demo/zh/train/open_small.py
```
